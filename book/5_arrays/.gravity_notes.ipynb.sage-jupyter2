The force acting on the projectile is\n\n$$F = -\\frac{Gm_\\mathrm{p}m_\\mathrm{e}}{x^2}$$\n\nwhere $x$ is the distance of the projectile from the centre of The Earth. Combining with Newton's second law of motion $F = m_\\mathrm{p}\\ddot{x}$ gives an equation relating acceleration $\\ddot{x}$ to position $x$:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{Gm_\\mathrm{e}}{x^2}$$\n\nFinally, introducing the velocity $v = \\dot{x}$ gives a coupled system of ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} &= v\\\\\n\\frac{dv}{dt} &= -\\frac{Gm_\\mathrm{e}}{x^2}\n\\end{align*}$$\n\n(Note that the mass of the projectile does not appear in this equation! Is this what you would expect?)\n\n## Two-dimensional Case\nAn object is floating at position $(x_1, x_2)$ relative to the earth which is assumed to remain stationory at position $(0, 0)$.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{x}$ be the position vector of the object and $\\mathbf{F}$ the force vector:\n\n$$\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n           x_{1} \\\\\n           x_{2}\n         \\end{bmatrix}$$\n         \n$$\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n           F_{1} \\\\\n           F_{2}\n         \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n$$$$\n\nNewton's law of gravitation states that the force has magnitude:\n\n$$F = \\frac{Gm_\\mathrm{e}m_\\mathrm{p}}{r^2}$$\n\nwhere $r = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$ is the distance between Earth and the object.\n\nThe direction of the force vector is a unit vector in the opposite direction to $(x_1, x_2)$ \n\n$$-\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{r} $$\n\nThe force vector is then:\n\n$$\\mathbf{F} = -\\frac{Gm_\\mathrm{e}m_\\mathrm{p}}{r^2}\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{r} =  -\\frac{Gm_\\mathrm{e}m_\\mathrm{p}}{r^3}\\mathbf{x}$$\n\nIntroducing the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\ddot{\\mathbf{x}}$ and using Newton's second law $\\mathbf{F} = m_\\mathrm{p}\\ddot{\\mathbf{x}}$:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} &= \\mathbf{v}\\\\\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} &= -\\frac{Gm_\\mathrm{e}}{r^3}\\mathbf{x}\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nDefining a timestep $\\Delta t$, then the position vector $\\mathbf{x}_{i+1}$ and velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}_{i+1}$ at timepoint $i+1$ can be calculated from the position and velocity vectors $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ at time point $i$:\n\n$$ \\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{x}_{i+1} &= \\mathbf{x}_i + \\mathbf{v}_i\\Delta t\\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_{i+1} &= \\mathbf{v}_i -\\frac{Gm_\\mathrm{e}}{r^3}\\mathbf{x_i}\\Delta t\n\\end{align*}$$\n\n","pos":0,"type":"cell"}

Line 1: In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
Line 2: A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Line 3: Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Line 4: Through caverns measureless to man
Line 5: Down to a sunless sea.
Line 6: So twice five miles of fertile ground
Line 7: With walls and towers were girdled round;
Line 8: And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
Line 9: Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
Line 10: And here were forests ancient as the hills,
Line 11: Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
